# SUBTEXT.ai 🕵️‍♂️  
**Understand what words do to you.  
Detect influence. React with clarity.**

SUBTEXT.ai is a small cognitive-defense tool.

You paste any text. It shows:

- 🟢 **Noise** — empty talk, corporate fluff, vague promises  
- 🧲 **Manipulation** — pressure, guilt, authority leverage  
- ☣️ **Hostility** — implicit or explicit aggression  
- 😰 **Emotional intensity** — fear, urgency, outrage, flattery…  
- 📊 **Informational value** — facts vs vagueness  
- 🧠 **Cognitive risk** (0–100) — how “dangerous” the message is for your brain  

Depending on the type of text, it also tries to estimate:

- 📰 **Credibility & political framing** (for articles / speeches)  
- 👤 **Probable bias of the author** (for forum / social posts, when signals exist)  

If the content looks conversational (email, DM, forum post...), SUBTEXT.ai can also generate a **short, assertive reply** in the same language.
